To compile:
    javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/*/*.java

To run:
    ./cs4500 file1 file2

    where

    file1 is the name of an existing file that contains
    textual input in the syntax specified below.

    file2 is the name of the scheme program output generated by
    software. When run, the scheme program will run generated tests 
    and output the results of the tests.

Notes:
	-For the StackInt example, tests can be generated as follows:
	
	(top (push (pop (empty)) -1))
	*rewrites to:*
	-1
	
	Even though (pop (empty)) would throw an error in a standard stack
	implementation.


Software used:
    JavaCC was used to generate the parser generator for
    this project.  The license for JavaCC can be found at

Source Layout:
    The main program is run from blackboxTester.BlackboxTester.  That
    calls into the following modules.

    blackboxTester.parser.Parser
        This is the main class for the parser.  It parses the input
        using the generated classes in blackboxTester.parser.generated.*.
        The returned code is an abstract syntax tree modeled by
        blackboxTester.parser.ast.*;

    blackboxTester.ast.generator.ASTGenerator
        This takes the parsed signatures and generates a series of
        abstract syntax trees that follow the signatures.  They are
        created using the objects in blackboxTester.ast.*
        
    blackboxTester.ast.Evaluate
    	This contains the function "replace" which rewrites ASTs
    	and throws out any that aren't applicable to testing (along with other
    	helper functions). It is called in main method of BlackboxTester.

    blackboxTester.outputGenerator
        This class is used last to generate the scheme output program. It uses
	a text file (outputTemplate.txt) as a template and is filled up with
        generated tests. When run, the scheme program runs the tests and displays 
	their results.
