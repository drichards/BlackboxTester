To compile:
    javac -d bin -cp assets/junit-4.10.jar -sourcepath src src/*/*.java
    
To run tests:
    java -cp bin:assets/junit-4.10.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore blackboxTester.tests.AllTests

To run:
    ./cs4500 file1 file2

    where

    file1 is the name of an existing file that contains
    textual input in the syntax specified below.

    file2 is the name of a file to be created by your software;
    when your program terminates, that file must contain the
    textual output of your program in the format specified
    below.

Notes:
	Non-deterministic checking has been implemented, so any non-deterministic
	expression will not be tested by the output test program.
	
	The following terminals are reserved identifiers and therefor should
	not be used in the input specification: 
	"Signatures:", "Equations:", "ADT:", ":", "->", "*", "int", 
	"boolean", "character", "string", "=", "+", "-", "<", and ">"

Source Layout:
    The main program is run from blackboxTester.BlackboxTester.  That
    calls into the following modules.

    blackboxTester.parser.Parser
        This is the main class for the parser.  It parses the input
        using the generated classes in blackboxTester.parser.generated.*.
        The returned code is an abstract syntax tree modeled by
        blackboxTester.parser.ast.*;

    blackboxTester.ast.generator.ASTGenerator
        This takes the parsed signatures and generates a series of
        abstract syntax trees that follow the signatures.  They are
        created using the objects in blackboxTester.ast.*
        
    blackboxTester.ast.Evaluate
    	This contains the function "replace" which rewrites ASTs
    	and throws out any that aren't applicable to testing (along with other
    	helper functions). It is called in main method of BlackboxTester.
    
    blackboxTester.outputGeneration.OutputGenerator
        This handles taking fully reduced ASTs and creating a scheme
        blackbox tester that will test the given algebraic specification.
